# Web-Design-Challenge

Website developed using HTML, CSS and Bootstrap to analyze how weather changes as you get closer to the equator. Analysis includes pulling data from OpenWeatherMap API to assemble a dataset on over 500 cities. Used Matplotlib to plot various aspects of the weather vs latitude. Factors we looked at included: temperature, cloudiness, wind speed and humidity. This site provides the source data and visualizations created as part of the analysis, as well as explanations and descriptions of any trends and correlations witnessed.
